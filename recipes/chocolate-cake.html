    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is absolutely The Best Homemade Chocolate Cake.  It is the only chocolate cake recipe you’ll ever need.  It’s perfect!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder (naturally processed, like Hershey's)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk well shaken (full-fat if you can find it)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup canola oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water (does not need to be boiling)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Butter and lightly flour two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, add the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the buttermilk, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla. Use an electric mixer to beat on medium speed for two minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the hot water to the cake batter. Mix on medium speed until well combined (the batter will be runny).</li>
        <li>Divide the batter between the two cake pans. Gently tap the pans on the countertop to release some of the air bubbles in the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake on a center oven rack for 32 to 34 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of the cake should come out with moist crumbs, but no raw batter on it. Test the cake for doneness at 32 minutes, even if it looks like the center needs to rise more.</li>
        <li>Cool for 15 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans. Place the cakes on wire cooling racks until they have cooled completely (around 2 hours).</li>
    </ol>
